Introduction
------------

The `Prime Focus Spectrograph`_ consists of approximately 2400 science fibers,
distributed over a 1.3 deg\ :sup:`2` field,
feeding four spectrographs, each comprised of blue, red and infrared arms
which together cover wavelengths of 0.38 - 1.26 microns.
It is the responsibility of the 2D Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) to process the raw data
to produce wavelength-calibrated, flux-calibrated coadded spectra suitable for science investigations.
This document outlines various algorithms used in the 2D DRP.
